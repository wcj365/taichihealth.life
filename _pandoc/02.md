## Free Public Tai Chi Classes

**International Center for Tai Chi Health (ICTCH) Offers Free Tai Chi Classes** 

Research performed by the world's top medical institutions for many years have shown that traditional Taijiquan (commonly referred as Tai Chi) fairs better at preventing and treating chronic diseases than modern medicines. Three hundred million people worldwide practice Tai Chi and their positive experiences are true testaments to the healing power of Taijiquan.

Tai Chi helps to regulate the flow of blood and Qi (vital energy), open up and align the meridians of the body, and has therapeutic effects on the mind, body, and soul.  No wonder Tai Chi is the most popular and effective form of exercise for prevention and healing of disease and nourishing of life.

If you have never been exposed to Tai Chi, don't worry, don't hesitate, and get ready.

The founding director of the International Center for Tai Chi Health， Master Zongqi Xie is a 12th generation descendant of Chen Style Taijiquan and an in-chamber disciple of Grandmaster Zhenglei Chen. Master Xie is a 7th Duan of Chinese martial arts and serves as a first-class national referee for Chinese martial arts. Master Xie has immigrated to the US and settled in Howard County, Maryland via a talent acquisition program in April 2022. Master Xie has a passion to help improve the health of people in communities across the county and the state using his sought-after Tai Chi know-how from decades of practice and teaching. 

To that end, Master Xie founded the International Center for Tai Chi Health (ICTCH) shortly after arriving in the US. The center was inaugurated on October 1st 2022 attended by County Executive Dr. Calvin Ball, elected officials, and medical researchers from Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland along with dedicated Tai Chi practitioners and enthusiasts.

In order to bring the health benefits of Tai Chi to individuals and communities across Maryland, the center led by Master Xie will start the “Traditional Tai Chi for Health” Campaign on November 6. 

The activities are as follows:

## 1. Free public Tai Chi promotion activities across Maryland

Stay tuned for more details to come.
