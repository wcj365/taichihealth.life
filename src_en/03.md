but highly theraputic workout can improve their health and happiness. 

This class consists of eight one-hour sessions with a maximum class size of 25 students.

## Class Objectives

This class aims to train the body as a whole to improve its balance and flexibility through stretching of 
muscles, ligaments, and tendons and coordinated movement of the upper limb, the trunk, and the lower limbs. 
It helps maintain balance, prevent falls, improve agility. It also helps regulate breathing, cultivate Qi, relax mind, and reduce stress. 

## Class Activities

### 1. Warm-up Exercises (伸筋拔骨术，关节操）

These exercises are design to loosen up the body and calm down the mind at the same time through stretching and relaxation.

The following areas are the main focus of the warm-up exercises:

- The Upper limb (wrists, elbows, shoulders, etc.)
- The Trunk (spine, back, lowback, chest, abdomen, etc.) 
- The Lower limb (hips, knees, and ankles, etc.)

### 2. Breathing Meditation （采气功）

This is a special type of standing meditation. 
It incorporates the control and coordination of breathing and body movement. 
It helps strength the lower body, reduces stress, and cultivate mindfulness. 

### 3. Standing Meditation (混元桩功)

This is a fundamental component of Chen-style Tai Chi. In standing meditation, the body may appear motionless but internally it is full of motion due to the increased circulation of Qi and blood through dredged meridian channels. 
Standing meditation also builds lower body strength to enable Tai Chi practice.  

### 4. Silk-reeling Methods （缠丝功）

Silk-reeling methods coordinate the upper limbs, the trunk, and the lower limb in a smooth and harmonious whole-body movement: 
when one part moves, all parts move. Even though all we see is external movement, the focus of silk-reeling
is to feel and cultivate the inner Qi. 

- One-hand front reeling （单手正面缠丝）
- Two-hand front reeling（双手正面缠丝）
- One-hand side reeling（单手侧面缠丝）
- Two-hand side reeling（双手侧面缠丝）
- Two-hand diagonal reeling（前棚后捋缠丝）

### 5. Chen-style Six Forms in Four Directions （六手四象）

This is considered the most basic Chen-style Tai Chi forms. It contains only six forms and can be performed without interruption 
many times rotating around the East-South-West-North four directions. Beginers can start out by learning one form at a time 
and continue to add more forms. After all forms are learned, students can perfrom them together and repeat the routine 
as many times as they feel comfortable.
